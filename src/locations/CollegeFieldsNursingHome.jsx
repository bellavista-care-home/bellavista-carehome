                How do we know what to put on? The activities organisers encourage all residents to join the (usually) monthly group who tell them what they like and don’t like. Isn’t it lovely to have some control over your life? Sometimes painting is the choice, or cookery. Yes cookery is popular even with those who because of dietary restriction cannot eat the results.

                  Sometimes getting out of the house is a delight. I remember when as a child my parents took me for a car ride. May seem very ordinary to those who are out and about all the time but when your not it can be special.

                  To help with this we run two vehicles that can take wheelchairs. A single wheel chair car is very helpful as it is inconspicuous and they can be like any other family going out for a coffee or going down the Island or the Knap. They could be going to the National Trust’s Dyffryn House, to see the house and gardens.

You may be like some of our ‘boys’ who went to a rock concert at St David’s Hall in Cardiff. They had a ball. Our ‘big’ minibus is well used for all manner of outings.

                  Certain facilities are available to every resident. Others are available to residents with particular needs.

These overheads give a smoother more reassuring transfer to the user of the hoist than the ‘portable’ ones.

                      However, they will have some similar features. For example, every room will have a three way hi-low electric bed. Why is this? The three way profiling bed matched with a specialist memory foam mattress will reduce a chance of developing skin tissue problems. With residents at high risk then extra steps may be needed such as ‘turning’ the person at regular intervals. Others with exceptionally high risk will be supplied with a alternating air flow mattress that stimulates the blood flow and eliminating as much as possible any area that may be at risk.

                    <p className="loc-text">
                      Each and every room has an overhead gantry with its own dedicated electric hoist. The advantage of these for the resident is the confidence of transferring comfortably and safely.

                      Room sizes vary considerably. Some are very ‘cwtchy’ a Welshism for cosy. Others a more grand. What we have found over the years is that everyone has their own idea of the right size for them. Hopefully, if the right sized room is not available on the day they enter they will be offered the right sized room for them when one becomes available.

Sometimes it is only residents enjoying themselves by art classes, the monthly non sectarian service or a get together to decide which events they would like in the following month. Every week there is a professional artist, singer or other artist. Sometimes there are unusual creatures that seem to be enjoyed by many but others choose to watch from a distance.

                    Our main kitchen creates four meals a day for residents. Residents have likes and dislikes about what they want to eat. Our kitchen staff try to cater for individual choices. All produce is sourced as locally as possible and as fresh as possible. We have a large team dedicated to making the ‘dining experience’ as good as it can be. All resident’s dietary needs are catered for. Whether each resident can eat traditionally, or need a ‘soft’ diet or even be peg fed or as is often the case, need assistance with actually eating, the team are there to help and support.

                          In addition to the main kitchen, there are small kitchens on every floor. Each one has a microwave, a kettle and a dishwasher. This enables staff at all times of day to prepare a hot or cold snack and a warm drink.

                          I have yet to meet a family who when visiting mum or dad don’t have a cuppa. When mum or dad’s home is College Fields then nothing should change. Family should be able to make a cuppa. So they will find tea and coffee. Cups and saucers (or mugs) available. Milk in the fridge. They should feel at home too!!!!

                          We regularly ask residents what they think of the service they have with us. We find this helpful as we can continue doing things they like and change things they don’t.
                      </p>
                      <p className="loc-text">
                          Our domestic staff, one of whom can be seen in the pictures above, not only keep everything as spotless as possible but also chat and take an interest in resident’s families. On one response to our questionaire the resident wrote that although no one ever came to clean her room it was always immaculate. The domestic staff in that case obviously did her job of interacting so well her cleaning taks were never noticed being done.
                      </p>
                      <p className="loc-text">
                          We have our own in house laundry as can be seen above. The commercial machine can be set to ensure that everything is hygenically washed for infection control purposes.

                      <p className="loc-text">
                          Reception staff are invaluable in welcoming new visitors to the home and ensuring visiting professionals know where to go so they waste none of their valuable time.

                          Administration in the modern world is more and more necessary. Not only to check the books balance but all the masses of client records are correctly filed so they can be found when needed.

                      <p className="loc-text">
                          We have a full compliment of trained, qualified nurses. These are supported by nurse auxiliaries. Both are trained to a high standard with the qualified nurses now generally to degree standards. They are responsible for supporting residents, understanding their medical and other needs and knowing how to react to their individual problems and needs.

                      <p className="loc-text">
                          Care practitioners support the top level nurses. They, too, are trained to a high standard here at College Fields. They undertake so much of the personal care helping each resident with their particular needs. Although care staff do not need to be registered with Social Care Wales until 2021 we are putting in place now all the preparatory education they will need to make their registration as swift and simple as possible
