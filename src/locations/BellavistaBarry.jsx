                We look at each of the residents who are participating to see whether there are any adjustments we need to make to help them get the most out of today’s sessions. Although we want to encourage our residents to push themselves, it’s essential that they don’t feel uncomfortable at any time. The dignity of our residents and our respect for them is at the centre of everything we do at our homes and especially in the activities department. We often review and assess the activities designed by the coordinator whilst also providing on-going training and development.
